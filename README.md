## How to run project

1. Open project in VSCode (for example)
2. Run command `npm i` in terminal (console) for installing all required packages (Node.js is required: <https://nodejs.org/en/>)
3. For builing project you can use the following commands:
   - `npm run build-prod` - building production version (minimized and optimized). The project will be builded into `build` folder. You can change destination in `webpack.common.js (line 19)`
   - `npm run build-dev` - building development version
   - `npm run serve` - building development hot-reloaded version with webpack-dev-server
